# Belly Button Biodiversity Study
Module 14 Challenge


## Goals and Objectives ##
In this week challenge, we have created a dashboard that displays the bacterial population found in the belly button of 153 subjects. A visual exploration is made possible to identify possible correlations between the distribution of bacteria found on an individual and his/her demographics such as ethnicity, gender, location, and age, as well as with the shape of his/her belly button and the weekly frequency it is being scrubbed. <br>
The dashboard can be viewed here:

## Method ##
The underlying data comes from a study made by the __departement of Applied Ecology__ of the __NC State University__ completed in 2012. [link](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).
<br> 
The __/static/js/app.js__ file containing all the code can be found [here](https://github.com/xoffvsg/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/static/js/app.js).
We left the intial index.html file from the starter kit untouched. All modifications in its code are done dynamically with javascript. Since the index.html file makes a reference to a __/static/js/bonus.js__ file, we created an empty file with this name in the same folder to avoid an error message. The code for the bonus activity is included in the __app.js file__.<br>
